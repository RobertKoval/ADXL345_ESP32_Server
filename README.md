# ADXL345 WebSocket Server for ESP32 C3 32S

This project provides a WebSocket server implementation to stream data from the ADXL345 accelerometer sensor using the ESP32 C3 32S as the microcontroller.

## Features

- Retrieves acceleration data from ADXL345 in real-time.
- Streams data to connected WebSocket clients.
- Works with the ESP32 C3 32S microcontroller.
- Displays sensor details on initialization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Have [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed.
- An ESP32 C3 32S board and an ADXL345 sensor module.
- Necessary libraries:
  - ESP32Time
  - ArduinoJson
  - WebSockets
  - Adafruit_Sensor
  - Adafruit_ADXL345_U

### Setup & Configuration

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Arduino sketch in the Arduino IDE.

3. Ensure that the required libraries mentioned above are installed.

4. **WiFi Configuration**:
   - Copy the `config_example.h` to a new file named `config.h`:
     ```bash
     cp config_example.h config.h
     ```
   - Edit `config.h` and provide your WiFi SSID and password.

5. Choose the correct board (ESP32 C3 32S) and port from the Arduino IDE.

6. Compile and upload the sketch to your ESP32 board.

### Usage

1. Once the sketch is uploaded and running, the ESP32 will connect to the provided WiFi network.

2. Monitor the Serial output (using Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE) to see the IP address assigned to your ESP32.

3. WebSocket clients can connect to the WebSocket server using the provided IP on port 81.

4. When a client is connected, the server will start streaming ADXL345 sensor data to the client.
